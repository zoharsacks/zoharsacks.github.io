<p><a href="http://www.amdocs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Amdocs</a>, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Checkpoint</a> and <a href="http://www.nice.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">NICE</a> are some of the global market leaders in the Israeli tech scene. A direct derivative of these success stories is a lot of enterprise software knowledge and network located in Israel, and all I we have to do is help it spread and scale. </p>
<p>In my view, There is a huge benefits in sharing knowledge both for the sharer and the sharee, but there where no “knowledge sharing space” in Israel, and most knowledge sharing was based on direct personal relations.To fix this situation I’ve decided to scale the knowledge sharing and founded <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Enterprise-Israel/" target="_blank" rel="external">Enterprise Software Israel Meetup</a>, a meetup for enterprise software experts.</p>
<p>In each meetup session we put in the same room startups and well established companies and assist them cross pollinate, we encourage open discussion and networking and had placed the cornerstone for several nice collaborations. </p>
<p>Enterprise Software Israel means business, there for it is held during business hours! people who come to the meetup <strong>come to do real work</strong>, we ARE having fun, but we came to work! if you wish to hang out and have free beer and pizza </p>
<p>We see valuable content as the king in “Enterprise Software Israel Meetup”, therefor we have “the rules of Enterprise Software Israel”</p>

<h3 id="—The_Rules_of_Enterprise_Software_Israel—">—The Rules of Enterprise Software Israel—</h3><ol>
<li>You do talk about Enterprise Software Israel.</li>
<li>You <strong>do talk</strong> about Enterprise Software Israel.</li>
<li>Content is the king - only A grade speakers who speak to the point and happy to have open discussion are invited.</li>
<li>Strict <strong>advertisement free policy</strong>, commercial entities that wishes to communicate with the community using the meetup <strong>must</strong> bring value to the table (sponsorship, special promo code, meetup swags and perks etc.).</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/look-mom-i-m-blogging/blogger.jpg" alt="usiness Baby Pointing by Paul Inkles"><br>It has been about 15 years since I first wanted to blog.<br>15 long years of going from “I have so much to say” to “but nobody gives a sh!t” until one day I had the luck to work for the amazing <a href="https://il.linkedin.com/in/arnonrgo" target="_blank" rel="external">Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz</a> which <a href="http://arnon.me/" target="_blank" rel="external">blogs mainly about technology he uses</a>. I had hours of conversations with Arnon about technology, bringing value, Bigdata, software architecture and my wish to blog…</p>
<p>Arnon solved my conflicts quite easily, “if you want to blog, just blog!”, <a href="/the-plain-and-simple-solution-to-most-of-our-creativity-barriers">The Plain and Simple Solution to Most of Our Creativity Barriers</a>.<br>At this point I got into the very fun procrastination game of “selecting the blogging platform” this fullish game can kill every initiative very fast, you focus on the wrong issues and wast your creative energy on solving them…</p>
<p>To cut a long story short - I’ve selected the easiest blogging system, customized it as little as possible and now I’m letting the content do it’s thing, if this blog will give any value to anyone I’ll have plenty of time to fiddle with it.</p>
<p>I’ll use this blog to share my view of my topics of interest, of which I can count:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship and Startups</li>
<li>Product</li>
<li>People</li>
<li>Management </li>
<li>Improvisation Theater and my amazing group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shirleyandthecans" target="_blank" rel="external">Shirley and the Cans</a></li>
<li>My meetup <a href="/enterprise-software-israel-meetup">Enterprise Software Israel Meetup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you will love my writing, will be happy to hear your thoughts, all my contact forms are on the left sidebar here please drop me a note. </p>
